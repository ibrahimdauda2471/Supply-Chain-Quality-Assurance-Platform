# Supply Chain Quality Assurance Platform

## Overview

The Supply Chain Quality Assurance Platform leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, immutable system for managing product quality throughout the entire supply chain. By establishing verifiable quality standards, tracking test results, monitoring supplier performance, and streamlining recall processes, the platform enables organizations to enhance product safety, reduce quality-related costs, and build stronger trust with customers and partners.
